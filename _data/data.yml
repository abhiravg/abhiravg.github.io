        100% success rate in the completion of any lifecycle task and essentially became a fire-and-forget operation for the 
        end-user.
            - Robustness parameters achieved: Re-entrant execution, fault tolerance against network or host restart issues, 
            enhanced error handling, enhanced ALCM microservice (**REST API redesign** for scalability, efficiency).
        - **DBdesign**: Modified existing schema as per **multi-tenant database** requirements, added **hash based partitions** and 
        **indexing**. Achieved a 3x improvement in data retrieval speed.
        - **Dockerized ALCM**: Owner/initiator of **containerized lifecycle operations** for the containerized monitoring Agent. 
        Developed one click solution to deploy 100s of containerized Agents, in parallel, on VMs instead of manually deploying 
        one Agent at a time.
        - **DirCompare**: Designed and developed an **in-house directory comparison tool in Python**. Improved software packaging and 
        footprint by 50% by eliminating redundant/outdated components from the software bundle using the said DirCompare tool.
