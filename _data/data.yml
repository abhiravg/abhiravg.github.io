        the ETL pipeline on GCP. \
        GCP: **Python, BigQuery, Apache Airflow** AWS: **PySpark, Hadoop, AWS EMR, AWS Athena, AWS Glue**.
        - **Docker**: Migrate the **containerized predictive model** from **AWS ECR to GCP GCR**. Change all references from AWS to GCP and migrate 
        all other dependencies like configurations etc. Test end to end execution of the pipeline and the model inference and, 
        publish results for business consumption.
        
    - role: Member of Technical Staff

        - **ALCM**: Lead developer to **enhance** robustness of **lifecycle operations** of the **Java based monitoring agent**. Result \- 
        100% success rate in the completion of any lifecycle task and essentially became a fire-and-forget operation for the 
        end-user.
            - Robustness parameters achieved: Re-entrant execution, fault tolerance against network or host restart issues, 
            enhanced error handling, enhanced ALCM microservice (**REST API redesign** for scalability, efficiency).
        - **DBdesign**: Modified existing schema as per **multi-tenant database** requirements, added **hash based partitions** and 
        **indexing**. Achieved a 3x improvement in data retrieval speed.
        - **Dockerized ALCM**: Owner/initiator of **containerized lifecycle operations** for the containerized monitoring Agent. 
        Developed one click solution to deploy 100s of containerized Agents, in parallel, on VMs instead of manually deploying 
        one Agent at a time.
        - **DirCompare**: Designed and developed an **in-house directory comparison tool in Python**. Improved software packaging and 
        footprint by 50% by eliminating redundant/outdated components from the software bundle using the said DirCompare tool.
        
    - role: Software Engineer Intern
      time: Jan 2017 - Jun 2017
      company: Retailio, Mumbai, India

        link: "https://github.com/smohan25/CS744-Project"
        tagline: "Efficient AllReduce implementation using Pytorch DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) with Gloo backend. Implemented Ring, Tree, Butterfly
        and Recursive Doubling and Halving topologies with sparse communication (COO format). Proved that Ring is optimal for dense tensors but for sparse tensors,
        you can have a variety of answers depending on the size of the tensor and the network bandwidth."
